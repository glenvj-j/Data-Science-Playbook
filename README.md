# ðŸ§  Machine Learning Rangkuman Notebook

This repository contains my **all-in-one Jupyter Notebook** that summarizes everything I've learned about **Data Analysis**, **Statistics**, and **Machine Learning** during my bootcamp journey.

It includes structured, hands-on steps from loading and cleaning data to building and evaluating machine learning models. This notebook is continuously updated as I learn new concepts and techniques.

Notes :

Statistic is still in Indonesian, will update it in the future
